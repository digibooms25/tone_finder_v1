1. Formality (-1 very casual to +1 very formal)
   - Consider: greeting style, word choice, punctuation, contractions
   - Example casual: "Hey! What's up?"
   - Example formal: "Dear Sir/Madam,"

2. Brevity (-1 verbose to +1 concise)
   - Consider: sentence length, redundancy, use of modifiers
   - Example verbose: "I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude"
   - Example concise: "Thank you"

3. Humor (-1 serious to +1 playful)
   - Consider: wordplay, emojis, informal expressions
   - Example serious: "The project deadline is approaching"
   - Example playful: "Time to slay this deadline! ðŸ’ª"

4. Warmth (-1 detached to +1 warm)
   - Consider: empathy, personal connection, encouraging language
   - Example detached: "Your request has been processed"
   - Example warm: "I understand how you feel, and I'm here to help"

5. Directness (-1 indirect to +1 direct)
   - Consider: passive vs active voice, hedging language
   - Example indirect: "It might be worth considering..."
   - Example direct: "Do this"

6. Expressiveness (-1 reserved to +1 expressive)
   - Consider: emotion, emphasis, punctuation variety
   - Example reserved: "The results were positive"
   - Example expressive: "The results were incredible!!!"

Score each trait from -1 to +1, where:
-1 = strongly exhibits the negative trait
0 = neutral or balanced
+1 = strongly exhibits the positive trait
